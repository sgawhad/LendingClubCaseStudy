## General Information
- This project provides an application for consumer finance company which specialises 
  in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for 
  loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, 
  which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount 
  of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
